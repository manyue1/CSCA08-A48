<CSCA08 Remark: Assignment #> - <MarkUs Username>

------------------------------
Full Name: Yue Man
MarkUs Username: manyue
Exercise/Assignment: A0

Please put a X beside the reason for this remark request, and complete the related fields:

_ I never received a report file.
	Date/Time file was submitted:

_ I have a report file, but I cannot see my mark on MarkUs.

_x I believe that there is a problem with the automarker
	Test case name: unittest.loader._FailedTest.test_a0
	Text copied from automarker: hijack.RestrictedFunctionError: Restricted function/module was detected. Restricted modules: random.
	Explanation of why you think this is incorrect: I use an restricted modules(random) in my code, because in validate_gene function,
by the time I finished my assignment, I have no idea how to finish it without random module. To import it, I put it at the begining, so the whole .py cannot be marked by the automarker and my automarker grade are 0. I believe ignore this function I still can get some point.

_ There has been a calculation error (the mark shown does not reflect the mark given in the report file/on MarkUs).
	Mark I believe I should have received:

_ I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied.
	The following are a list of sections where I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied, and an explanation
	of what I believe to be wrong (one section per line)
	
	example:
	Internal Comments - I have comments in my entire file, but I received a commenting mark of 0/2
